## 📦 Deployment to Vercel

To deploy this application with SSR enabled on Vercel, follow these steps:

1. **Rename index.html file**:
   - Rename your `src/index.html` to something like `src/indexFile.html` (or any other name)

2. **Update angular.json**:
   - Change the `index` property in your `angular.json` to point to the renamed file:
   ```json
   "index": "src/indexFile.html",
   ```

3. **Add vercel.json**:
   - Create a `vercel.json` file in the root of your project with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "version": 2,
     "public": true,
     "name": "angular-ssr-vercel",
     "rewrites": [
       { "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/api" }
     ],
     "functions": {
       "api/index.js": {
         "includeFiles": "dist/angular-ssr-vercel/**"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

4. **Export app variable in src/server.ts**:
   - Make sure the Express app is exported in your `src/server.ts` file:
   ```typescript
   // Change from:
   const app = express();

   // To:
   export const app = express();
   ```
   - This export is required for the api/index.js file to properly import the app

5. **Create api/index.js**:
   - Create an `api` directory in the root of your project
   - Create an `index.js` file inside the `api` directory with the following content:
   ```javascript
   // This file serves as the entry point for Vercel's serverless function
   // It imports the Angular SSR server and handles requests

   // Import required modules
   const path = require('path');

   const serverDistPath = path.join(process.cwd(), 'dist/angular-ssr-vercel/server/server.mjs');

   export default import(serverDistPath).then(module => module.app);
   ```

6. **Deploy to Vercel**:
   - Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
   - Select "Angular" as the framework preset
   - No additional configuration is needed in the Vercel dashboard
   - Deploy your application

The project is now configured for seamless deployment with SSR enabled on Vercel.
